 * Real, user-supplied deposit addresses. DO NOT let anyone edit these

 * incorrect address means their funds are unrecoverable.
 *
 * The EVM address (0xcCe5...) was provided once by the owner and is
 * applied to all standard EVM-compatible networks, since a single EVM
 * wallet address is valid to receive funds on any EVM chain (ERC20,
 * BEP20, Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, AVAX, opBNB all share the same
 * 0x address format from the same wallet).
 *
 * Networks with no address on file here (TON, CELO, and the internal
 * "خارج السلسلة" transfer) are intentionally left out — the Receive
 * screen shows "not available" for these rather than guessing.
